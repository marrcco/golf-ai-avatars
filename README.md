# AI Golf Avatars Generating

## Project Overview

The AI Golf Avatars Generating project aims to create unique and engaging AI-generated avatars placed within various golf courses across North Carolina. This innovative endeavor serves not only as a showcase of artificial intelligence capabilities but also as a public relations article highlighting the beauty and diversity of North Carolina's golfing landscapes. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, we transform standard golf course imagery and information into vibrant, dynamic avatars enjoying the sport in these picturesque locations.

## Data Collection

Our journey begins with the meticulous scraping of data from a premier website dedicated to showcasing the best golf courses in North Carolina. The information collected includes:

- **Course Name:** The official name of each golf course.
- **About Course:** A brief description or overview of the golf course, highlighting its features, history, or unique selling points.
- **Image of Course:** Visual imagery capturing the essence and beauty of each golf course.

This data undergoes a thorough cleaning process to ensure it is in a format conducive to our AI-driven objectives.

## AI-Driven Image Description

The first phase of our project utilizes the OpenAI API Vision Model to analyze the collected golf course images. The goal here is to generate detailed descriptions of each image, capturing the essence of the golf course's landscape, layout, and notable features. This descriptive data lays the groundwork for the next phase of avatar generation.

## AI Avatars Generation

Leveraging the powerful DALL·E 3 model, we embark on the creative process of generating AI avatars. These avatars are not just randomly placed figures; they are contextually integrated into the golf courses based on:

- **Golf Course Name:** Ensuring each avatar is associated with the correct location.
- **Location:** Geographical and visual cues from the golf course influence the positioning and activities of the avatars.
- **Image Description:** Provided by the Vision model, these descriptions inform the DALL·E 3 model about the specific environment, ambiance, and elements to include when generating the avatars.

## Purpose and Impact

This project not only demonstrates the potential of AI in creating engaging and contextually rich images but also serves as a PR article that accentuates the scenic beauty and allure of North Carolina's golf courses. Through this innovative fusion of technology and creativity, we aim to captivate and inspire golf enthusiasts, AI aficionados, and the general public alike.

## Getting Started

To explore this project and perhaps contribute or create your own AI golf avatars, please ensure you have access to the OpenAI API for both the Vision Model and DALL·E 3. Follow the steps outlined in the documentation for setting up your environment and initiating the data processing and image generation pipelines.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from developers, AI enthusiasts, and golf fans. Whether it's improving the algorithm, expanding the dataset, or enhancing the avatar generation process, your input can help take this project to the next level.
